## Craft

Minecraft clone for Windows, Mac OS X and Linux. Just a few thousand lines of C using modern OpenGL (shaders). Online multiplayer support is included using a Python-based server.

### Features

* Simple but nice looking terrain generation using perlin / simplex noise.
* More than 10 types of blocks and more can be added easily.
* Supports plants (grass, flowers, trees, etc.) and transparency (glass).
* Simple clouds in the sky (they don't move).
* Day / night cycles and a textured sky dome.
* World changes persisted in a sqlite3 database.
* Multiplayer support!

### Multiplayer

After many years, craft.michaelfogleman.com has been taken down. See the [Server](#server) section for info on self-hosting.

#### Client

You can connect to a server with command line arguments...

```bash
./craft [HOST [PORT]]
```

Or, with the "/online" command in the game itself.
    
    /online [HOST [PORT]]

#### Server

You can run your own server or connect to mine. The server is written in Python
but requires a compiled DLL so it can perform the terrain generation just like
the client.

```bash
gcc -std=c99 -O3 -fPIC -shared -o world -I src -I deps/noise deps/noise/noise.c src/world.c
python server.py [HOST [PORT]]
```
